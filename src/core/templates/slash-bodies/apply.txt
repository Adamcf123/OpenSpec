**Guardrails**
- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when it is requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.
- Refer to `openspec/AGENTS.md` (located inside the `openspec/` directory—run `ls openspec` or `openspec update` if you don't see it)  is a must.

**Steps**
Track these steps as TODOs and complete them one by one.
1. Read `changes/<id>/proposal.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md` to confirm scope, acceptance criteria, rollout expectations, and outstanding questions.
2. Work through tasks sequentially, keeping edits minimal and focused on the requested change while updating `design.md` decisions if new trade-offs surface.
3. Confirm completion before updating statuses—make sure every item in `tasks.md` is finished and linked to a validation artifact (tests, logs, manual runs).
4. Update the checklist after all work is done so each task is marked `- [x]`, and mirror the final state back into `proposal.md`/`design.md` where outcomes or mitigations changed.
5. Reference `openspec list` or `openspec show <item>` when additional context is required, and note any follow-up work in the change record.

**Reference**
- Use `openspec show <id> --json --deltas-only` if you need additional context from the proposal while implementing.
